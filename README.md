### Hi. I'm Wager.
I guess I'm sort of a roblox developer now. I've done 3 commissions. I do other stuff too, but just as a hobby. I'm mostly always on time, if there's a deadline.

The main services I offer are: Scripting commissions, game testing, and bugfixing.
If you want my services:
I take Robux, Gift Cards, and Crypto.
Script commissions will be paid based on time and complexity with a price negotiated beforehand.
Game testing is a solid 1k. I will give you a full evaluation and point out exploit vulns afterwards. If you want me to fix those vulns too, depending on complexity, it could range around 2k-4k extra.

My minimum hiring fee is 1k Robux OR 10$ USD in your preferred method.
