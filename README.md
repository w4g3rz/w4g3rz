### Hi. I'm Wager.

I guess I'm sort of a Roblox developer now. I've done 5 commissions. I do other programming stuff too, but just as a hobby. I'm mostly always on time, if there's a deadline. If you want my services, I accept Robux, Gift Cards, and Crypto. I specialize in scripting commissions, game testing, and bug-fixing. I'm familiar with exploits and know how to combat them, and am very well versed at reading pre-existing code, so it's no problem for me to work as a team or based off of something, and I have friends to help me if need be.

Commissions will be paid based on time and complexity with a price negotiated beforehand. Game testing is a solid 1k, including a full evaluation highlighting the experience, bugs, and exploit vulnerabilities afterwards. If you want me to fix these bugs too, depending on complexity, it could range around 2k-4k extra.

My minimum hiring fee is 500 Robux OR 5$ USD in your preferred method.
